Auto-update logic:
  - start with 2 GPUs / hour => 6 requests/hour => 4320 requests/month
    - 252 GPUs / 2 => 126 hours => fresh data every 5-6 days
  - Store queue in file, so we can pick up where we left off
  - build queue when queue is empty
  - order by release date, no release dates should be first

Immediate Tasks:
    - symlink public folder to outside of packages
    - store data outside of packages
    - code cleanup:
      - create crawler class.
        - Consider using a class base structure?
      - change "base" text value to 16px, not 18px.
      - make tailwind screen sizing min instead of max
        - seeing lg:text-xl implies large screens have text-xl
    - content: add rank for company performance. Figure out how to do db query
    - relative performance and relative value should be filtering based on market segment

  - folder structure for pages and components
    - look at List GPUs page for example
    - <feature>/pages/<page-name>/components/
      - Components only used on the page for this feature.
    - <feature>/pages/<page-name>/hooks/
      - Hooks only used on the page for this feature.
    - <feature>/components/
      - Components used across multiple pages for this feature.
    - <feature>/hooks/
      - Hooks used across multiple pages for this feature.
    - TODO: where to place utils and services?
    - folders and files should use PascalCase and camelCase except for package folders
  - Scraping improvements
    - Add download date when importing
    - Allow ability to overwrite existing gpus
  - Fix bug where unauthorized pages doesn't display
  - Improve security for reset password (add expiration to jwt)
  - code clean up
    - rename videocardbenchmarks to videocardbenchmark
  

Post-launch:
- remove usage of router.push.
- set up auto backups
- add audit events table
  - track all changes to content
- improve import dialog
  - show all values
- List Page
  - filtered rank
  - infinite scroll
- View and Compare Page
  - Write summaries for each table/section
  - Add tooltips for each spec
  - look into using useController
- on-site SEO
  - Add alt tags
  - html semantics
  - sitemap
- improvements to part and image cache?
  - are they needed? could it be done better
- improve related parts
- improve admin panel
